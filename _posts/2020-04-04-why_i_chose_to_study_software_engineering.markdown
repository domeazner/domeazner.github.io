When going through any change in life there are many things you have to ask yourself especially if it is likely to change your circumstances in a significant way.  With the constantly evolving job environment and shifting of traditional work roles many around the world at this moment many in employment, management and self employment must be dynamic in order to meet future demands for work. 

I chose to study software engineering for a multitude of reasons but the main one was in order to have a consolidation of knowledge and ready to go for work on day one.  I have always taught myself and learned by myself however, like the saying goes ‘no man is an island’ the same goes for software engineering.  It is such a collaborative effort that if you learn siloed you can have difficulty when needing to work in groups on projects and the like.

Flatiron School gives that opportunity to get a leg up with collaboration, accountability and know how in order to thrive outside the self taught environment, and I very much look forward to my progress.
